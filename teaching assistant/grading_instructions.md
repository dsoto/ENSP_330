# ENSP 438 Grading Instructions

The purpose of grading is to find where the student should consult the
solution and check their work against the solution.  The homework will
be scored on a 3 level scale (A, B, C) or (check, check +, check -).
Students have the option to turn in a second assignment where they talk
about why their initial attempt was not correct.

- Double check solution for accuracy, completeness, and clarity.
- Make any suggestions for improving solutions
- On spreadsheet, indicate which students have turned in homework and
  which is late
- For each question indicate whether the problem is
    - Numerically accurate
    - Has sufficient explanation
- Make an estimate of the overall time spent grading
- In pencil on the spreadsheet, give your initial assessment (check,
  check plus, check minus)
- Grade in blue ink, if possible (I'll grade in green ink.)
- Report to me any common student errors or misconceptions


The course instructor will assign the overall grade and recommend which
problems they comment on.  As a grader, you help me make this
determination with your grading.

We will have a one-hour meeting for each problem set to go over and
record grades.
