## Course Description

A lecture/discussion course designed to assist students in understanding
energy as a fundamental measure of organization, structure, and
transformation in society.  Principal topics include: energy history;
thermodynamics; energy resources and conversion technologies; global
issues and trends; environmental impacts; energy economics,
institutions, and politics.  Elementary quantitative analysis.

## Learning Objectives
- Development of critical thinking skills applied to global energy issues
- Develop model thinking and quantitative estimation skills for energy use
- Understanding of the multiple technical, social, and policy issues
  surrounding energy implementations

## Course Requirements
This course will have two main components, quantitative analysis and
critical thinking. In addition to learning the relevant material,
students will be challenged to integrate and interrogate new ideas
presented during readings and discussion.
Homework will consist of both quantitative assignments and essay
questions.
Quizzes will be given weekly to review material.
Students will come to class prepared to participate in and sometimes
lead discussion.

## Grading
- Classroom work (quizzes, participation) 25%
- Homework (problem sets, readings) 25%
- Exams (midterm, final) 25%
- Research project 25%


## Agreements

- Respectful tone in classroom

Civility is required from all students during discussions and
interactions.  In general, I expect students to be supportive of each
others learning goals.

- Minimize electronic distractions

Internet-connected electronic devices (phones, tablets) may be used in
class for learning purposes.  If these devices distract from your
learning or your classmates learning I reserve the right to limit their
use.

- Willingness to take risks and experiment

I frequently try new approaches to teaching and learning.  These are
always with the intention of making this class as beneficial to you as
possible.

## Course Schedule

This course schedule is tentative and subject to change.
The course is loosely organized into four sections.  The first is to
cover some basic quantitative tools we will need to analyze energy
systems.  Then we will learn about our most important sources of energy,
followed by our most common uses.  The last part of the course will
focus on the intersection of energy with the environment and human
well-being.

## Readings

We will have many reading assigned throughout the semester.  There will
typically be a reflection essay or short quiz assigned on each reading.

The tentative reading schedule is posted below.  I will also add
readings during the semester that reflect current events or the
interests of the class.

{{ d['reading-schedule.md'] }}

## Project Schedule

You will investigate a project in teams.
You will choose a question related to energy and the environment
and then use techniques from this class to create estimates.
The learning goals are for you to explore relevant topics in energy
resource use in a ways similar to professional work.
There will be a separate document that explains the expectations for the
project that I will hand out in a few weeks.

The tentative project schedule is listed here:

{{ d['project-schedule.md'] }}

## Homework

<!-- numerical credit/no-credit and feedback? -->

The goal of the homework is to give you practice and feedback on
techniques for solving energy problems.  You will perform both
quantitative and writing exercises.
Often we combine these so that you will gain
practice making your quantitative methods and reasoning clear to others.
Your problem sets will be graded on the clarity of communication as much
as the correctness of the result.

I will be experimenting with various homework assessment
and feedback techniques throughout the semester.  Please have faith that
these experiments have improving your learning as the main goal.

The tentative homework schedule is listed here:

{{ d['homework-schedule.md'] }}

## Classroom Work

We will often perform individual and group work in class.  These may
take the form of writing exercises, group exercises, or quizzes.
If you have
an unexcused absence on the day of work, you will not receive credit for
that day's assignment.
