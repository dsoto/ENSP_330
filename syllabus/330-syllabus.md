## Course Description

A lecture/discussion course designed to assist students in understanding
energy as a fundamental measure of organization, structure, and
transformation in society.  Principal topics include: energy history;
thermodynamics; energy resources and conversion technologies; global
issues and trends; environmental impacts; energy economics,
institutions, and politics.  Elementary quantitative analysis.


## Learning Objectives
- Development of critical thinking skills applied to global energy issues
- Develop model thinking and quantitative estimation skills for energy use
- Understanding of the multiple technical, social, and policy issues
  surrounding energy implementations

## Course Requirements
This course will have two main components, quantitative analysis and
critical thinking. In addition to learning the relevant material,
students will be challenged to integrate and interrogate new ideas
presented during readings and discussion.
Homework will consist of both quantitative assignments and essay
questions.
Quizzes will be given weekly to review material.
Students will come to class prepared to participate in and sometimes
lead discussion.

## Grading
- Classroom work (quizzes, participation) 25%
- Homework (problem sets, readings) 25%
- Exams (midterm, final) 25%
- Research project 25%


## Homework
Energy problems require quantitative solutions.  You will gain practice
solving simple problems about energy.  Equally importantly, you will gain
practice making your quantitative methods and reasoning clear to others.
Your problem sets will be graded on the clarity of communication as much as the
correctness of the result.

## Agreements

- Respectful tone in classroom

Civility is required from all students during discussions and
interactions.  In general, I expect students to be supportive of each
others learning goals.


- Minimize electronic distractions

Internet-connected electronic devices (phones, tablets) may be used in
class for learning purposes.  If these devices distract from your
learning or your classmates learning I reserve the right to limit their
use.

- Willingness to take risks and experiment

I frequently try new approaches to teaching and learning.  These are
always with the intention of making this class as beneficial to you as
possible.

## Course Schedule

This course schedule is tentative and subject to change.
The course is loosely organized into four sections.  The first is to
cover some basic quantitative tools we will need to analyze energy
systems.  Then we will learn about our most important sources of energy,
followed by our most common uses.  The last part of the course will
focus on the intersection of energy with the environment and human
well-being.

## Project Schedule

You will investigate a project in teams.
You will choose a question related to energy and the environment
and then use techniques from this class to create estimates.

Here is the tentative project schedule.

| Date            | Project              |
|:----------------|:---------------------|

| Tue 11 Nov 2014 | First draft feedback |
| Thu 20 Nov 2014 | Final report         |

## Homework

You will be graded both on the
validity of your work as well as your ability to communicate your
methods.  This means that in addition to the mathematics, you should be
providing brief explanations of your techniques and your thought
process.  Calculations without supporting arguments will not receive
full credit.

Homework will be graded on a coarse grading schedule of a 1, 2, or 3.  A
3 is given for strong work that meets or exceeds the requirements, a 2
for adequate work, and a 1 for work that doesn't meet expectations.
No late unexcused homework will be accepted.

<!-- After grading, you may submit a self-evaluation that considers how your -->
<!-- approach differs from the accepted approach.  Self-evaluations that -->
<!-- demonstrate an improvement in your understanding will raise your -->
<!-- homework grade through partial credit. -->



Here is the tentative homework schedule.

## Classroom Work

We will often perform individual and group work in class.  These may
take the form of writing exercises or quizzes.  If you have
an unexcused absence on the day of work, you will not receive credit for
that day's assignment.
