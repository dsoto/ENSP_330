## Course Description

A lecture/discussion course designed to assist students in understanding
energy as a fundamental measure of organization, structure, and
transformation in society.  Principal topics include: energy history;
thermodynamics; energy resources and conversion technologies; global
issues and trends; environmental impacts; energy economics,
institutions, and politics.  Elementary quantitative analysis.


## Learning Objectives
- Development of critical thinking skills applied to global energy issues
- Develop model thinking and quantitative estimation skills for energy use
- Understanding of the multiple technical, social, and policy issues
  surrounding energy implementations

## Homework
Energy problems require quantitative solutions.  You will gain practice
solving simple problems about energy.  Equally importantly, you will gain
practice making your quantitative methods and reasoning clear to others.
Your problem sets will be graded on the clarity of communication as much as the
correctness of the result.

## Course Requirements
This course will have two main components, quantitative analysis and
critical thinking. In addition to learning the relevant material,
students will be challenged to integrate and interrogate new ideas
presented during readings and discussion.
Homework will consist of both quantitative assignments and essay
questions.
Quizzes will be given weekly to review material.
Students will come to class prepared to participate in and sometimes
lead discussion.


## Grading
- Classroom work (quizzes, participation) 25%
- Homework 25%
- Midterm 20%
- Research project 10%
- Final exam 20%


## Agreements
- Respectful tone in classroom
- Minimize electronic distractions


## Required Texts

*Sustainability without all the Hot Air*, MacKay.
You can download the text in PDF format at
[withouthotair.com](http://www.withouthotair.com)

*Natural Capitalism*, Lovins.

Other readings will be posted online to Moodle.


## Course Schedule

This course schedule is tentative and subject to change.
The course is loosely organized into four sections.  The first is to
cover some basic quantitative tools we will need to analyze energy
systems.  Then we will learn about our most important sources of energy,
followed by our most common uses.  The last part of the course will
focus on the intersection of energy with the environment and human
well-being.
