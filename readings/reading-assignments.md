# Reading Assignments

You may select an article or reading and provide a 800 word essay on the
significance of the article and whether or not you believe the evidence
or argument provided is compelling.  You may also discuss the
implications of the issue discussed in the article.    How would this
issue affect human, the economy, or the environment?  Be clear in the
introduction about what your goal is in your essay.  Each assignment is
worth up to 10 points.

- Your essay should be structured as a critique of the article and
  should make an argument
- Your essay should clearly distinguish between opinions or normative statements
  and factual statements
- Those statements that can be backed with evidence should clearly state
  the evidence you are using in support


Your submission should be a single PDF file with a link to the online
article so that I can also read it.
