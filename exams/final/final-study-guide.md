# ENSP 330 Final Exam Study Guide

Studying for the final exam gives you an opportunity to look back at all
the material we have covered over the entire course.  I hope you are
impressed by how much you have learned.

To study for the final, I recommend reviewing all your materials from
the class.  Skim over your notes, the class slides, and the reading to
remind yourself of all the topics we have covered in class.  Identify
some of the key themes that have been repeated like energy conversion,
energy efficiency, cost/benefit, and others.

Pay special attention to the problem sets.  You should be able to
explain in words to a classmate, how to solve each of the problems.
Explaining the problem solving strategy in words will reinforce your
conceptual understanding of the material.  It is more important that you
understand the big picture than the small details.
