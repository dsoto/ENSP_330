In your own words, state the first law of thermodynamics.  Why is this
important to energy systems?

From the EIA chart, what are the main energy uses, or if you want to
reduce petroleum, what sector would you focus on


<!--
This is important because there will always be energy losses.
-->

In your own words, state the second law of thermodynamics.  What is an
important implication of this law?
