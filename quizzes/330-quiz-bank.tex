\problem{}
Two identical coal plants are built in two different places.  According
to the second law of thermodynamics, which one is likely more efficient?

a) A plant in Saudi Arabia

b) A plant in Antarctica

\solution{

The second law tells us that the highest possible efficiency for a plant
is

$$ \eta = 1 - \frac{T_C}{T_H} $$

Since the coal plants are identical, we expect $T_H$, the temperature of
the boiler, to be the same.  $T_C$ however, the temperature of the
environment, should be lower in Antarctica and the plant will be more
efficient.

\problem{}
Which technology emits less carbon dioxide for each kilowatt-hour of
electricity produced?

a) A coal electricity plant

b) A natural gas electricity plant

b) 0.30 kg CO$_2$ per mile

c) 266 kg CO$_2$ %30 * 8.87

\solution{
kg CO2/mile = 8.87 kg CO2/gallon * gallons/30 miles = 0.30 kg CO2 / mile
