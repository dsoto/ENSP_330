# ENSP 330 Homework 3

Due Date: Tuesday, October 15th


## Problem 1

Heat engine efficiency

a) What is the maximum possible efficiency of a generating plant that has a
steam temperature of 550C and an environmental temperature of 20C? (5
pts)

b) How does this compare to a typical coal plant efficiency of 35%? (5
pts)

c) Name a few plausible reasons for the efficiency of a real plant being
less than the ideal. (5 pts)


## Problem 2

Capacity factor

Two plants are built.  One is a 1 MW coal plant, the other is a 1 MW
solar photovoltaic plant.  The coal plant has a capacity factor of 0.8
and the solar photovoltaic plant has a capacity factor of 0.2.

a) How much energy does each plant produce in a year? (10 pts)

b) Why is it important to consider the capacity factor when comparing
these two plants? (5 pts)


## Problem 3

Life cycle analysis

A Prius costs $24,200 and has 51/48 mpg (city/hwy).  A Toyota Tacoma truck costs
$17,875 and has a milage of 21/25 mpg.  Assume that gasoline costs $3.50
per gallon.  Also assume you can get a monthly loan that costs $22.13
for each $1000 borrowed.  You may use a spreadsheet to make the
calculation easier.

a) What is the monthly cost of the loan for each vehicle. (5 pts)

b) If the car is driven X miles (only on the highway) in a month,
calculate the gasoline cost per month for each car. (5 pts)

c) For what value of X is the total cost (car payment and gasoline) the
same for both cars? (5 pts)

d) What do you find interesting about this result? (5 pts)


## Problem 4

Estimate to the nearest hour the time you spent on this homework. (5
pts)
