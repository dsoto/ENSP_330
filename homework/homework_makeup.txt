# ENSP 330 Homework Makeup Assignment

You can turn in a supplement to your homework for partial credit.
The
assignment is also to identify what your difficulty was and turn in a
correctly worked version of the problem.

It is much more important that you correctly identify your issue (for
your own benefit) than that you turn in a corrected version.  As we
stress in this class, the method you used to get an answer is as
important as the answer.

The grading will primarily be on the quality of your self-analysis.  If
you do not adequately address your original difficulty, you will get no
credit despite having the correct answer.

You are eligible for 75% of the points missed for questions you
attempted but answered incorrectly.  If you did not attempt the problem
the first time, that problem is not eligible for make up credit.

1) Staple your corrections to the back of the original problem set.
2) Clearly indicate which problems you are submitting for partial
credit.
3) Your solution will be graded on your self-assessment and the clarity
of your solution.
