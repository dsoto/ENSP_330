# Homework Makeup Assignment

You can turn in a supplement to your homework for partial credit.
However, the assignment is not only to turn in corrected problems.  The
assignment is also to identify whether your difficulty was conceptual or
computational and what you have done to correct it.

For example, if I messed up a unit conversion problem because I
incorrectly used my calculator, I'd say that that was a computational
problem and that I was practicing scientific notation with my calculator
to be sure I got it correct in the future.

In another problem, I might have misunderstood the difference between
power and energy.  In this case, I would say that I had a conceptual
problem distinguishing between power and energy and that I've been
studying the difference.

In both cases I'd submit the problem correctly worked as well.  To
receive partial credit, the self-analysis should be both clearly worded
and match your issue.  You will hand in the original problem set as well.
It is much more important that you correctly identify your issue (for
your own benefit) than that you turn in a corrected version.  As we
stress in this class, the method you used to get an answer is as
important as the answer.
