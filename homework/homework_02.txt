## Problem 1

Largest global energy consumers

Use the Energy Information Agency website to find data for this problem.
Indicate what data you found to answer the questions.

a) Which countries have the first and second amount of primary energy
consumption per year?  What is the amount for each in joules?

b) Showing your work, calculate the per capita energy consumption for
each of these countries.

c) Comment on the differences between these two countries.



## Problem 2

Your Utility Bill

Find your electricity and gas bill or borrow one from a friend or family
member.

a) Extrapolating from the monthly bill, what is your estimated yearly use
in electricity in kWh?

b) What is your estimated yearly use in natural gas in therms?

c) Convert both of these to joules.  Which is greater?

d) Which form of energy is more expensive in terms of dollars per
delivered joule?

e) Estimate your yearly carbon dioxide emissions in kg for each form of
energy.  For the California grid, use the value of 659 pounds carbon
dioxide per MWh.  For natural gas, use 5 kg carbon dioxide per therm.
Which is greater?

f) Which form of energy emits more carbon per joule delivered?

g) What are some possible strategies your you that will have the greatest
reduction of carbon emissions?



## Problem 3

Driving Energy

a) Estimate your energy use in driving your car.  Based either on mileage
or on how frequently you fill your tank, estimate the amount of energy
in joules you use monthly in the form of gasoline.  Document your
assumptions.

b) How does this compare with the amount of energy you consume in
electricity?



## Discussion

Based on the Amory Lovins 1976 article.  Please hand this part in
typewritten.

a) Describe the difference between soft and hard energy paths in your
own words.  (Approximately 100 words)
