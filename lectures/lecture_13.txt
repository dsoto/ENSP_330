# Hydropower

## Ancient Power Technology
- Waterwheels have been used for centuries
- Modern hydropower technology has added large scale dams

## Hydropower is significant world wide
- http://wdi.worldbank.org/table/3.7
- 2010 Hydropower 15.9% of world wide electricity
- Coal 40.5%, Nuclear 12.8%
- Largest power station in the world is hydroelectric


## Three Gorges
- Largest power plant in the world
- Displaced millions of people
- 22 GW power continuous
- NYC - 10 GW

## Grand Coulee
- Largest hydroelectric installation in US
- 6.8 GW capacity
- 21 Billion kWh annual energy delivered


## Hydropower

### Advantages
- Once built, very cheap power
- Reliable technology
- Can be used as storage

## Hydropower
- Uses spinning generators just like combustion plant
- Doesn't use heat, unlike combustion plant

## Turbine types

### Waterwheels
- Undershot
- Breastshot
- Overshot

### Turbines
- Impulse
- Reaction
