# Energy in Antiquity

## Biological Energy Conversion
- Plants convert radiant energy into chemical energy
- Humans convert chemical energy into human activity
<!--
- We essentially burn food in our bodies
- since all fossil fuel comes from plants, it is essentially solar
-->

## Food Gathering Techniques
- Foraging
- Hunting
- Agriculture
- Livestock
<!--
- how can you see each of these in terms of energy?
- can we think of energy impacts of our modern food system?
-->


## Fire
- Stored chemical energy in wood to heat
- Allowed for tool making
- Allowed for cooking
<!--
- Richard Wrangham, primatologist argues that:
- cooking saves energy in digestion
-->

## Fire Sources
- Wood, biomass, dung
- Coal
- Coke
- Oil
- Gas
<!--
- what sources do humans burn for use
-->

## Amplifying human power and energy
- Ancient machines
    - Lever
    - Spring

<!--
- lever converts small force over large distance to large force over
  small distance
- springs store energy as mechanical potential energy
-->

## Hunting Machines
- Bow and arrow
    - energy is stored in bow and release quickly
- Spear and Lever
    - Lever allows hunter to impart more kinetic energy to the spear
      than with the arm alone
- Guns
    - Chemical energy converted to kinetic energy in bullet

<!--
- this advantage lead to higher energy input in human diets
-->

## Human Thermoregulation
- Our superior ability to remove heat energy from our bodies allows us
  to outrun prey animals


# Beyond Human Power

## Livestock
- Oxen
- Horses
- Allowed humans to cultivate more land, but required more land for food
<!--

    - converts kinetic and potential energy in water to rotational
      motion
    - estimated 500,000 waterwheels in Europe

## Water photos

# Thermodynamics and heat engines

## Heat Engines
- Stored chemical energy is burned to create thermal energy
- Thermal energy is converted into mechanical work

## Heat Engine
![](./figures/heat_engine_vector.png)

## Carnot Heat Engine
![](./figures/carnot_cycle.png)
- Heat is used to expand a gas and do work and heat is removed during
  the compression of the gas.

## Power plant
![](./figures/heat_engine_plant.jpg)

## Power plant
![](./figures/coal_plant_cooling_towers.jpg)

## Heat Engines
- Heat engines have limits to efficiency dictated by the laws of
  thermodynamics
- Maximum possible efficiency is related to the temperature of the hot
  reservoir and of the cold reservoir

## Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics
- If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system,
  they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other.

## First Law of Thermodynamics
- Energy is conserved
- Energy cannot be created or destroyed
- "You can't get something for nothing"

## First Law Efficiency
- Most commonly used measure of efficiency
- Useful energy out divided by total energy in

## Second Law of Thermodynamics
- The amount of entropy (disorder) in a closed system always increases
- Heat flows spontaneously from hot to cold
- "You can't break even"

## Second Law Efficiency
- First law efficiency divided by best possible efficiency dictated by
  the second law
- It isn't always obvious what the best possible second law efficiency is

## Third law of Thermodynamics
- The entropy of a perfect crystal at absolute zero is exactly equal to
  zero.
- When we make calculations using the second law, we use the kelvin
  temperature scale which starts at absolute zero.

## Temperature Scales
![](./figures/temperature_scales.jpg)

## Entropy
- Measures the disorder in a system
- Is related to the number of microstates

## Quality
![](./figures/mechanical_thermal.jpg)

## Quality
![](./figures/heat_engine.jpg)

## Thermodynamic limit to heat engine
- Carnot derived the upper limit of efficiency for a heat engine
$$\eta = 1 - \frac{T_C}{T_H}$$

<!--
what happens when T_C goes to zero?
what happens when T_C and T_H are close to each other?

- why is capital cost of electricity so much more expensive than coal?
- can we show this in a calculation?
- Since we can't keep the bathtub filled because the hot water keeps running
  out, do we really (as Malcolm MacEwen asks) need a bigger water heater, or
  could we do better with a cheap, low-technology plug?
- technical fixes and social changes
- avoided cost of energy (capital cost)
- what is the argument for efficiency?
- what is life cycle costing?  (difference between mpg and whole car cost)
- official predcitons are 130-170 quads primary energy, what is reality?
- what is energy income vs energy capital?
- what is energy quality?
- why is electricity overused in amory's opinion?
- why isn't solar a soft technology?
- what kinds of solar are not soft?  why not?
- IX democratized power production
- "the most important questions of energy strategy are social and ethical"
- lovins believes we can almost eliminate electricity

## Calculate cost of conserved energy
- Buying a more efficient technology is like buying electricity you were
  already going to use at a cheaper price

## Estimate mass of carbon emissions avoided
- We use the carbon intensity of the electric grid and the amount of
  electricity saved

## What have we ignored?
- How could we improve the accuracy of these calculations?
- When would we need greater accuracy?

<!--

- what is simple payback?
- what is return on investment?

- cheapest thing to do is sit in the dark

## Climate dice
- Averages
- Anomalies

<!--
- blackboard discussion of probability
-->

## Distributions
- When we shift the average temperature we also shift the extremes
- Cold extremes become less likely
- Hot extremes become more likely

## Climate dice
- James Hansen
- We can think of a weather pattern as a given die
- Climate change loads the die and changes the likelihood of
  different results for each roll of the die

## Warm anomalies
- A shift in the average temperature increases the likelihood of very
  hot weather

## Summer temperature anomalies

## Insurance
- Even though risk is uncertain, we protect ourselves.
- Auto insurance
- Fire insurance

## Review

## Climate science questions
- Is the climate changing?
- Is human activity responsible?
- What will the future impacts be?
- What can we do?

<!--
- we have covered the first two
- today we'll talk a bit about the next two
-->


## What will the future impacts be?
- Predictions based on computer climate models
- Confidence in models is increasing

<!--
- models have the capacity to predict current climate based on past
  information
-->

## What can we do?
- Mitigation
- Adaptation
- (Geoengineering)

## Mitigation
- Actions that seek to reduce carbon emissions and avoid climate change

## Adaptation
- Actions that seek to minimize the affects of climate change


## Benefits and costs
- To pursue a plan, the benefits should outweigh the costs

## Wedges
- A technology that can reduce carbon emissions over time

## Stocks and flows
- Stock - total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
- Flows - rate of carbon dioxide emission

<!--
- which wedges seem plausible?
- can we think of new wedges that aren't here?
-->

## Local mitigation efforts
- Climate protection campaign
- Sonoma Clean Power

<!--
- what is unique to sonoma
- low density makes transit reduction difficult
- what is the contribution of agriculture?
-->
