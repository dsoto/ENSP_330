## Announcements

## Upcoming Deadlines
- One-page research proposal October 22nd
- Midterm October 24th

<!--
what aspects of electricity are you most interested in?
-->

## Primary Energy
- Coal
- Oil
- Natural gas
- Sunlight

## Secondary Energy
- Electricity is an energy carrier

## Electricity is different than other energy carriers
- Invisible
- Indistinguishable
    - Once you put power on a grid, you cannot trace its path
- Immediate
    - Electricity is very difficult to store
    - Moving electricity is inefficient

## Grid

## Frequency control
![](./figures/supply_demand_bathtub.pdf)

## Environmental Impact of Electricity
- In US, one-third of carbon emissions are from electricity

## Carbon intensity of electricity
![](./figures/egrid.pdf)

## World Generation
![](./figures/Annual_electricity_net_generation_in_the_world.pdf)

## Thermal Electric Efficiency
![](./figures/electricity_grid_efficiency.pdf)

## Quality of energy
- Electric energy is very high quality
- Electric conversion is inefficient
- It is best used for high quality tasks

## U.S Electricity Price

<!--
what are some plausible reasons for the difference in oil and
electricity volatility?
-->

## Global electricity
- Approximately 20% of population has no access to electricity

## African Proposed Grid

## United States Grid

## Questions
- Can we create more generation without adding transmission?

## What do we use electricity for?
- In American homes:
- Air conditioning 22%
- Lighting 14%
- Water Heating 9%
- Refrigeration 9%
- Space heating 9%
- Electronics 7%
- Computers 4%
- Cooking 2%

## Demand
![](./figures/stacked_demand.pdf)

## Efficiency
- Do we build more plants to meet demand?
- Can we use efficiency to avoid demand?

## Distributed generation
- Can we create more generation without adding transmission?
- Can we make the electricity where we need it?


## What fraction of carbon emissions?
- Electricity is responsible for 33% of United States carbon dioxide
  emissions

## Soft and hard paths
- How are large wind and solar farms hard or soft according to Amory
  Lovins?


## Electricity Economics and Policy

## Regulated monopolies
- Monopoly franchise
- In return for monopoly rights, business is heavily regulated

## PURPA
- Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978
- Allowed independent power producers (IPPs) to connect to the utility
  grid.
- Encouraged competition
- Guaranteed a market for new power plants

## Decoupling
- Decouples a utility companies profits from the amount of electricity
  sold.

## Electric power

## Electricity
- What aspects of electricity are you most interested in?
- Contributions to climate change
- Supply must match demand
- Electricity cannot be shipped
- Electricity charges vary by state and country
- Electricity not evenly distributed throughout the world
- Environmental impact
- Energy quality
- Capacity factor examples

## Discussion topics
- Barriers to clean electricity
- New laws dictating electricity

## Electricity prices relatively stable
- Electricity is regulated
- Electricity uses several sources of primary energy

## Load Duration Curve
![](./figures/load_duration_curve.pdf)

## Capacity Factor
- Related to the fraction of time that a plant produces electricity
- Coal and nuclear, about 80% or higher
- Renewables, about 20%

## Load Duration Curve
![](./figures/load_duration_curve_2.pdf)

## Screening curve example
- How is the price of electricity determined?
- How do we decide which plants to turn on?
