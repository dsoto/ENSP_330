## Historical Record

## Questions
- How does current climate compare to past climate?
- Is our warming unusual or related to natural variation?
- What if it has been this warm before without anthropogenic CO2?

## Climate dice
- Averages
- Anomalies

<!--
- blackboard discussion of probability
-->

## Distributions
- When we shift the average temperature we also shift the extremes
- Cold extremes become less likely
- Hot extremes become more likely

## Climate dice
- James Hansen
- We can think of a weather pattern as a given die
- Climate change loads the die and changes the likelihood of
  different results for each roll of the die

## Warm anomalies
- A shift in the average temperature increases the likelihood of very
  hot weather

## Summer temperature anomalies

## Insurance
- Even though risk is uncertain, we protect ourselves.
- Auto insurance
- Fire insurance
