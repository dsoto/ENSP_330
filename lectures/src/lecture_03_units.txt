## Scientific Notation
- How do we express very large and very small numbers?

## A very large number
- Avogadro's Number
- $6.02 \times 10^{23}$ (1/mole)
- $10^{1}$ = 10
- $10^{2} = 10 \times 10$
- $10^{3} = 10 \times 10 \times 10$

## A very small number
- Gravitational Constant
- $6.67 \times 10^{-11} (m^3 kg^{-1} s^{-2})$
- $10^{-1} = \frac{1}{10}$
- $10^{-2} = \frac{1}{10 \times 10}$
- $10^{-3} = \frac{1}{10 \times 10 \times 10}$

## Standard Prefixes

## Operations
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

## Scale of energy quantities

- from IPCC Energy Primer

## Exercise
- List some units you know that use SI prefixes

## Exercise
- Write down the population of the world in scientific notation
- According to BP statistical review, 2008 worldwide energy consumption
  was 474 exajoules.  Write this number with and without scientific
  notation.

## Energy Units
- Joule
    - SI Unit.  One Newton-Meter.
- Kilowatt-Hour
    - Energy consumed by 1 kW load over one hour
- Calorie
    - Energy to heat one gram of water one degree Celsius
- Kilo-calorie
    - One thousand calories.  Used in food energy content.
- British Thermal Unit (BTU)
    - Energy to heat one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit
- Quad
    - One quadrillion ($10^{15}$) BTU

## Unit Conversions
- We may wish to compare energy units that are not consistent
- Often you can look up conversions in a table
- Other times you may need to recreate the conversion

## Exercise
- Convert miles per hour to meters per second
- Calculate the number of seconds in a year

<!--
possible homework questions
- convert from btu to kWh
- convert from btu to gasoline equivalent
- car, what is cost difference in fuel for CAFE standards 20 years ago and today?
-->

## Back of the Envelope Calculations
- Construct a model of appropriate complexity
- Gather estimates of necessary quantities
- Calculate estimate
- Evaluate for feasibility

## Exercise
- Estimate the daily use of gasoline in the US
