## Modeling
- Using mathematics to predict the natural world
- Both science and art

## A small electric water heater
- Power supply
- Electric Resistor
- Water
- Insulated container

## Exercise
- Electric Water Heater
- Draw diagram of system
- Where is energy going?
- Calculate temperature rise after 10 minutes

## Drawings and representations
- Drawing that captures physical layout
- Diagram that captures energy flows
- Mathematical representation

## Physical drawing

## Energy diagram

## Mathematical representation

## Getting quantitative
- How do we determine the energy from the resistor?
- How do we determine the rise in temperature?
- Do we have our units consistently expressed?

one drawing may be an accurate reflection of the system
another drawing may be a better way to depict energy flows

## Estimate the temperature rise of the water in 10 minutes

## Exercise
- Using 2 kg of coal with heat content of 30 MJ/kg
    - How much energy (in J) is the coal?
    - How much water can we raise in temperature from 15C to 50C
      assuming 100% efficiency?

## Exercise
- Using 2 kg of coal with heat content of 30 MJ/kg
- How much electricity in kWh can we generate assuming 35% efficiency?

<!--
make a list of assumptions and units
draw on board to support exercise
anthracite coal 30 MJ/kg
3.6 MJ/kWh
how much electricity if 100% efficient?
how much if 30% efficient?
-->

## Exercise
- How much energy did it take to heat your shower water this morning?
- Calculate in joules and kWh

<!--
make a list of assumptions and units
this is part back of the envelope and part calculation
how long is your shower?
how much water per minute? 2 gallons per minute
how much volume per mass? 3.79 liters per gallon
we can derive heat capacity from calorie
4.186 J per g of water
how hot is shower water?
how hot did it start?

## Reading Discussion
- Lovins, Energy Strategy: The Road Not Taken?

<!--
article notes
- what is lovins arguing?
- what are the central points in his essay?
- is he convincing?
- what is a subsidy?
- which path did we follow?
- what does the consumption data say about predictions in II?
- what is a capital cost?
- why is capital cost of electricity so much more expensive than coal?
- can we show this in a calculation?
- Since we can't keep the bathtub filled because the hot water keeps running
  out, do we really (as Malcolm MacEwen asks) need a bigger water heater, or
  could we do better with a cheap, low-technology plug?
- technical fixes and social changes
- avoided cost of energy (capital cost)
- what is the argument for efficiency?
- what is life cycle costing?  (difference between mpg and whole car cost)
- official predcitons are 130-170 quads primary energy, what is reality?
- what is energy income vs energy capital?
- what is energy quality?
- why is electricity overused in amory's opinion?
- why isn't solar a soft technology?
- what kinds of solar are not soft?  why not?
- IX democratized power production
- "the most important questions of energy strategy are social and ethical"
- lovins believes we can almost eliminate electricity
