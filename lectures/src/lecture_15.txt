## Geothermal
- Very similar to other thermal plants
- Source of heat is hot rock
- Water is pumped down and turned to steam

## Geothermal generation
- The Geysers
- Operated by Calpine

## Geothermal plant
- Middleton, CA, Google maps
- Bear Canyon

## Tidal Energy
- Tides caused by the moon's gravity
- Causes a daily flow of water

## Tidal power

## Wave Energy
- Waves are driven by the wind (which is driven by the sun)
- Uses the rise and fall of wave crests to create energy
