## Major sources of energy on Earth
- Sunlight
- Internal radioactive decay
- Gravitational Potential
- Tidal Energy

## Solar radiation
- Conversion of mass energy to radiation
- Converts hydrogen to helium

## Solar Energy
- Approximately 1000 watts per square meter on the surface of the earth
  at peak
- 170 watts per square meter average insolation

## Solar radiation
- Solar radiation drives many processes on Earth
- Wind
- Waves
- Ocean Currents
- Atmospheric Currents

## Water evaporation
- Latent heat absorbed during evaporation of water
- Latent heat released during rain

## Producers
- Plants
- Algae
- Convert radiation energy to chemical energy
- Create biofuel for all organisms

## Efficiency
- A measure of how well a resource is converted
- Defined as desired energy out divided by energy in
- $\eta = \frac{E_{out}}{E_{in}}$

## Exercise
- List some examples of efficiency measurements you are familiar with

<!--
we couldn't come up with any, really.
says something about efficiency and society that we don't have language
for it.
miles per gallon
lumens per watt
-->


## Efficiency of plants
- How efficiently do plants convert sunlight into biomass (chemical
  energy)?

## Exercise
- How would you calculate the efficiency of crop production?
- What would be input energy?
- What would be output energy?
- What do you exclude from your model?

## Net Primary Production
- Intensive crops average 2% efficiency
- Global production is 120 billion tons on land and 110 billion tons in
  oceans per year

## Consumers
- Primary Consumers
    - Herbivores
    - Insects
- Secondary, Tertiary Consumers
    - Carnivores
    - Omnivores

## Energy pyramid

## Livestock
- Cows are herbivores
- How much sunlight energy goes into each kilogram of beef?
- What is the chemical energy?

## Exercise
- How efficient is beef production?
- What would be the input energy?
- What would be the output energy?


## Energy content of foods
- Carbohydrates 17 MJ/kg
- Protein 23 MJ/kg
- Lipids 39 MJ/kg



## Energy inputs to food production
- Mechanization of tilling, harvest
- Transportation of food
- Processing
- Refrigeration and storage

<!--
- need to do quick refresher on area and volume
-->

## Exercise
- If you consume 2500 food calories per day, how many joules is that?
- What is your equivalent rate of power consumption in watts?
- How many acres of wheat could supply you with this energy?

<!--
100 g hard red winter wheat
energy 1368 kJ
energy 327 kcal
yield 41.7 bushels per acre
yield 2.24 metric ton per hectare
hectare = 10^4 square meters
