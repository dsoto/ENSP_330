# Macro energy picture

## Definitions
- Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
- Per capita GDP (GDP per person)
- Per capita energy use (Joules per person)
- Energy intensity (Joules per GDP)

## US primary energy intensity

## Annual residential energy per capita

## Per capita electricity consumption

## US electricity consumption
- ![](./figures/US_electricity_consumption.pdf)
- let's do rough conversion to per capita

## Consumption growth

## State energy consumption per capita
- ![](./figures/eia_state_consumption_per_capita.pdf)
- Why does California have high consumption but low consumption per capita?

## US carbon emissions
- ![](./figures/US_carbon_emissions.pdf)
- What are possible reasons for the increase over time?
- For the decrease recently?

# Life Cycle Analysis

## Life Cycle Analysis
- Uses energy or economic inputs throughout the entire life cycle of a
  product or process to evaluate efficiency.
- Initial Costs
- Recurring Costs

## Compare two cars
- Honda Civic, $18165, 28 city, 39 highway
- Honda Civic Hybrid, $24360, 44 city, 44 highway
- What is the cost of gas per year assuming 15000 miles per year at a gas cost of 3.50 per gallon?


## Light bulbs
- Incandescent GE Reveal, $1.46, 1000 hours, 630 lumens
- LED, Philips, $50, 30000 hours, 940 lumens
<!--
$1.46 / 1000 = $0.00146/hour
$50/30000 = 0.00167/hour
-->
- What is the capital cost of the bulb per hour
- What is the cost of electricity to run each bulb for a year?
