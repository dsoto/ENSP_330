## Energy Conversion
- Energy must be converted
- Often energy must be transported

<!--
- announcements
- internship deadline today
- is everyone getting emails about readings and assignments?
- assignment sent out today, due next tuesday start of class
10:05
-->

## Types of energy conversion
- Matrix of energy conversions

<!--
- at whiteboard, enumerate different transitions with help from class
- radiation, chemical, thermal, kinetic, electrical, nuclear,
  gravitational
- generators
- motors
- batteries
- photosynthesis
- waterfalls
- muscles
- joule heating
-->

## Efficiency
- A measure of how well a resource is converted
- Defined as useful energy out divided by total energy in
$$\eta = \frac{E_{out}}{E_{in}}$$


## Efficiencies
- Electrical generators (70--99%)
- Electric motors (50--90%)
- Gas furnace (70--95%)
- Wind turbine (35--50%)
- Fossil fuel power plant (30--40%)
- Nuclear power plant (30--35%)
- Automobile engine (20--30%)
- Solar cell (5--28%)
- Fuel cell (40--60%)

<!--
- how efficient could these be?
- we will answer these questions in the coming lectures
-->

## Multiplication of efficiencies
- When we want to know the efficiency of a process with many steps, we
  multiply the efficiencies at each step to get the total.
$$\eta_{total} = \eta_1 \cdot \eta_2 \cdot \eta_3 \cdots$$

## How do we measure efficiencies?
- How do we measure energy?

## Kinetic energy
- The kinetic energy of a moving object is proportional
    - mass of the object
    - square of the object's velocity
$$E_{kinetic} = \frac{1}{2} m v^2$$

## Exercise
- Calculate the kinetic energy in a car traveling down 101
- Express units in joules and kWh
- What quantities do you need to know?  In what units?

<!--
we'll arrive at estimates together
calculate independently
-->

## Gravitational potential energy
- The stored gravitational energy of an object is proportional to
    - mass of the object
    - the height difference
    - gravitational acceleration (9.8 m/sec^2)
$$E_{gravitational} = m g \Delta h$$

## Gravitational potential energy

## Exercise
- Drive the same car from the beach to the top of Mount Tamalpais
- What is the gravitational potential energy relative to the beach?
- Calculate in joules and kWh

elevation 2572 feet, 784 meters

## Thermal energy
- Thermal energy proportional to
    - mass of the object
    - difference in temperature
    - heat capacity of material
$$Q = E_{thermal} = m c \Delta T$$
