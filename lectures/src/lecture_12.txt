# Life Cycle Analysis

## Light bulb example
- Initial costs
	- purchase
	- installation
- Recurring costs
	- electricity

## LED Bulb
- $13, 9.5 watts, 800 lumens, 25000 hours

## Incandescent Bulb
- $0.50, 60 watts, 860 lumens, 1000 hours

## Carbon Intensity
- Embedded carbon
- Carbon Intensity of Electricity
- Coal 2009 Average 2249 lb CO2/MWh
- Natural Gas 1135 lb CO2/MWh
- Hydro, Wind, Solar, Nuclear 0 lb CO2/MWh
- Proposed EPA Limit 1100 lb CO2/MWh for coal
- 1000, 1100 lb CO2/MWh for natural gas

## State Electricity Carbon Intensity Averages
- Washington 287 lb/MWh
- California 633 lb/MWh
- Virginia 1232 lb/MWh
- West Virginia 2027 lb/MWh

## Calculate lifetime cost
- We consider initial and electricity cost
- We choose a convenient period of time to analyze

## Calculate cost of conserved energy
- Buying a more efficient technology is like buying electricity you were
  already going to use at a cheaper price

## Estimate mass of carbon emissions avoided
- We use the carbon intensity of the electric grid and the amount of
  electricity saved

## What have we ignored?
- How could we improve the accuracy of these calculations?
- When would we need greater accuracy?

<!--
- calculate cost of electricity per year
- calculate cost of electricity over bulb lifetime
- compare LED and CFL
- calculate carbon emitted for each per year, per lifetime
- calculate cost of conserved energy
- compare to the cost of daylighting

- analyze as an investment
- what is simple payback?
- what is return on investment?

- cheapest thing to do is sit in the dark
- we must compare to something sensible

- there is lots of flexibility in the analysis here
- do i count the difference in initial cost?  electricity cost?
- thats why the clarity of your methods matters


- discuss second order costs
- incandescent heating
- window energy leakage

- pose the choice between buying electricity at $0.15 cents or $0.05
  cents
- pose the choice between carbon tax or avoiding tax

- we are neglecting the time value of money

## Carbon Abatement Curve
- Calculates the cost and amount of carbon that could be saved by
  various efficiency technologies
