## Efficiency
- The ratio of desired energy divided by input energy

## Efficiency
- A measure of how well a resource is converted
- Defined as useful energy out divided by total energy in
$$\eta = \frac{E_{out}}{E_{in}}$$


<!-- need reinforcement exercises here -->

## Efficiencies
- Electrical generators (70--99%)
- Electric motors (50--90%)
- Gas furnace (70--95%)
- Wind turbine (35--50%)
- Fossil fuel power plant (30--40%)
- Nuclear power plant (30--35%)
- Automobile engine (20--30%)
- Solar cell (5--28%)
- Fuel cell (40--60%)

<!--
- how efficient could these be?
- we will answer these questions in the coming lectures
-->

## Multiplication of efficiencies
- When we want to know the efficiency of a process with many steps, we
  multiply the efficiencies at each step to get the total.
$$\eta_{total} = \eta_1 \cdot \eta_2 \cdot \eta_3 \cdots$$


## Temperature
- Measure of the internal energy in a system or material
- This energy is the motion, vibration, or rotation of atoms and
  molecules

## Heat
- Heat is the flow of this energy from one area to another
- Conduction
- Convection
- Radiation

# Thermodynamics and heat engines

## Heat Engines
- The heat engine is a mathematical model
- Takes the heat (flow) between two thermal resevoirs and converts some of
  that heat to work
- Heat can come from combustion or natural sources of heat

## Heat Engine
![](../figures/heat_engine_vector.png)

## Carnot Heat Engine
![](../figures/carnot_cycle.png)
- Heat is used to expand a gas and do work and heat is removed during
  the compression of the gas.

## Power plant
![](../figures/heat_engine_plant.jpg)

## Power plant
![](../figures/coal_plant_cooling_towers.jpg)

## Heat Engines
- Heat engines have limits to efficiency dictated by the laws of
  thermodynamics
- Maximum possible efficiency is related to the temperature of the hot
  reservoir and of the cold reservoir

## Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics
- If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system,
  they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other.
- Real world example: Coffee gets cold, ice cream melts

## First Law of Thermodynamics
- Energy is conserved
- Energy cannot be created or destroyed
- "You can't get something for nothing"

## First Law Efficiency
- Most commonly used measure of efficiency
- Useful energy out divided by total energy in

## Second Law of Thermodynamics
- The amount of entropy (disorder) in a closed system always increases
- Heat flows spontaneously from hot to cold
- "You can't break even"

<!--
## Second Law Efficiency
- First law efficiency divided by best possible efficiency dictated by
  the second law
- It isn't always obvious what the best possible second law efficiency is
-->

## Third law of Thermodynamics
- The entropy of a perfect crystal at absolute zero is exactly equal to
  zero.
- When we make calculations using the second law, we use the kelvin
  temperature scale which starts at absolute zero.

## Temperature Scales
![](../figures/temperature_scales.jpg)

## Entropy
- Measures the disorder in a system
- Is related to the number of microstates

## Quality
![](../figures/mechanical_thermal.jpg)

## Quality
![](../figures/heat_engine.jpg)

## Thermodynamic limit to heat engine
- Carnot derived the upper limit of efficiency for a heat engine
$$\eta = 1 - \frac{T_C}{T_H}$$
- This law dictates the maximum possible efficiency for power plants
- Some of the heat must be released into the environment

<!--
what happens when T_C goes to zero?
what happens when T_C and T_H are close to each other?

## Exercise
How much energy does the average person in the United States use each
year?

## Strategy
- Find a figure for US energy use
- Find a figure for the US population
- Checking units says to divide the two

<!--
- US energy use about 100 Quads (quadrillion BTU)
- US energy about 100 ExaJoules per year
- 1 Quad = 10^15 BTU = 10^18 Joules
- 300 * 10^6 persons
- 300 * 10^9 Joules per person
- divided by one year of seconds = 10.6 kW per person
-->

## Exercise
The world uses 474 EJ of energy per year.  How much is that per person per year?

## Strategy
- Find global energy use
- Find global population
- Divide

<!--
- Worldwide (wikipedia) 474 Exajoules
- population 7 billion
- 474E18 / 7E9 = 67 GJ per person
-->

## Exercise
What is the average power that each US person consumes?

## Strategy
- Use the definitions of power and energy with what we know about US
  energy usage per year

<!--
- 100 Exajoules / population / (3.14 * 10^7 seconds)
-->



## Exercise
We calculated that each American on average consumes 300 GJ of energy
each year.

How many barrels of oil would provide that amount of energy?

## Strategy
- How much energy is in a barrel of oil

<!--
- barrel of oil equivalent = 6.1 GJ = 6.1E9 Joules
- 300 GJ / 6.1 GJ/barrel = 49.1 barrels of oil
-->

## Exercise
How many kilograms of coal would provide that energy?

<!--
- coal is about 30 MJ/kg
- 300 GJ / 30MJ/kg
- 300e9 / 30e6 = 10e3 = 10 tons of coal
-->

## Strategy

## Exercise
What is the volume of this much coal?

<!--
- coal is slightly denser that water
- 1200 kg/m^3
- 10e3 kg coal / 1200 kg/m^3 = 8.3 cubic meters
- this is a 2m x 2m x 2m box

## Simplified Photosynthesis and combustion

Photosynthesis

- CO~2~ + H~2~O + Sunlight (Radiation Energy) $\to$ C~X~H~Y~O~Z~ + O~2~

Combustion

- C~X~H~Y~ + O~2~ $\to$ CO~2~ + H~2~O + Heat Energy

## Real combustion

- The atmosphere is not purely oxyen, it also has nitrogen and other
  elements
- Fossil fuels are not pure carbon and hydrogen, they contain impurities
  like sulfur and mercury
- When all these chemicals participate in combustion, they produce
  sulfur oxides (SO~X~), nitrous oxides (NO~X~), and other chemicals
- These chemicals are the cause of acid rain and other environmental
  effects

# Hydropower

## Energy basics
- We use the simplest model for the water as a mass at a height or
  elevation
- A mass $m$ lifted to a high $h$ has a stored gravitational potential
  energy of
$$ PE = mgh $$
- PE is in joules if mass is in kilograms, g = 9.8 m/s^2^ and the height
  is in meters

## Power
- How do we convert this to a power?
$$ energy = mgh $$
$$ \frac{energy}{time} = \frac{mgh}{time}$$
$$ power = \frac{m}{time} gh$$
$$ power = flow \cdot gh$$
- To get flow in mass per time we convert from volume per time

## Ancient Power Technology
- Waterwheels have been used for centuries
- Modern hydropower technology has added large scale dams

## Types
- Run of river
- Dams

## Hydropower is significant world wide

## Activity Objective
- You will gain practice with energy conversions and estimations

## Gasoline and car height

We want to compare the chemical energy in a gallon of gasoline to the
potential energy of lifting a car?

<!-- A gallon of gasoline contains approximately 120 MJ of chemical energy. -->

## Units
- What are the units of the energy = mgh formula if we use kilograms, g=10
m/sec, and h in meters?


## Gravitational energy
If that energy were totally converted into the gravitational potential
energy of the car, how high could you lift the car?  A Honda Civic has a
weight of about 1100 kg.


## Solution
$$ PE = mgh = 120 MJ = 1100kg \cdot 9.8 m/sec^2 \cdot h $$
$$ h = 120 MJ / 1100 kg / 9.8 = 11.0 km $$

## Wind map
- [Real time wind map](http://hint.fm/wind/)



# Energy Basics

## Wind Energy
- Converts kinetic energy to electrical energy
- Wind energy is the conversion of solar radiation to kinetic energy

## Kinetic Energy

A mass $m$ traveling at a speed $v$ has a kinetic energy

$$ \frac{1}{2} m v^2 $$

Note the units
$$ \frac {kg \cdot meter^2}{sec^2} = 1\ Joule $$

## Fan Law
![](../figures/VM-fan-law-1.jpg)

## Fan Law
$$ Power = \frac{1}{2} \rho A v^3 $$

- $\rho$ density of air (kg per cubic meter)
- $A$ swept area of wind turbine (square meters)
- $v$ velocity of the air (meters per second)
- Power is in watts

## Air density
- How much does the air weigh?
- About 1.2 kg per cubic meter
- Varies with altitude
- Varies with temperature

## Wind speed variation with height
- Boundary layer friction
- This is turbulence caused by the ground, trees, or buildings


## Air density

Hotter air is less dense

| Temperature (degrees Celsius) | Density (kg per cubic meter) |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| 0                             | 1.29                         |
| 15                            | 1.23                         |
| 30                            | 1.17                         |

## Efficiency limit
- Can you extract all the kinetic energy from the wind?

## Efficiency limit
![](../figures/VM-betz-law-1.jpg)

## Where do we want to put turbines?
$$ P = \frac{1}{2}\rho A v^3 $$

- Based on this formula, what are good locations?
- Away from the turbulent air on the ground
- Around steady winds
- In areas with good air density

## Similarities and differences
- What similarities does wind share with other generation?

## Learning Objectives

## Review
- Primary and Secondary energy
- We are moving from sources of energy to uses of energy

## Primary Energy
- Coal
- Oil
- Natural gas
- Sunlight
- Hydropower
- Wind power
- Which of these are used to create secondary energy?

## Secondary Energy
- Electricity is an energy carrier
- Gasoline

## Electricity is different than other energy carriers
- Invisible
- Indistinguishable
    - Once you put power on a grid, you cannot trace its path
- Immediate
    - Electricity is very difficult to store
    - Moving electricity is inefficient

## Grid
There is a complex system that distributes our electricity from the
point of production to the point of consumption
![Masters: REEPS2](../figures/grid_masters.pdf)

## Frequency control
This supply and demand must be balanced perfectly at all times or the
frequency will change.
![Masters: REEPS2](../figures/supply_demand_bathtub.pdf)

## Environmental Impact of Electricity
- In US, one-third of carbon emissions are from electricity
- A large fraction of fresh water withdrawals are for power cooling
- Pollutants from burning create toxic by-products


## Carbon intensity of electricity
The amount of carbon emitted per unit of electrical energy changes
depending on the state.
![EPA Egrid Data](../figures/egrid.pdf)

## World Generation
![](../figures/Annual_electricity_net_generation_in_the_world.pdf)

<!--
- dominated by fossil
- renewables dominated by hydropower
-->

## Thermal Electric Efficiency
The second law of thermodynamics tells us that much of the chemical
energy of fuel is lost as heat.
![](../figures/electricity_grid_efficiency.pdf)

## Quality of energy
- Electric energy is very high quality
- Electric conversion is inefficient
- It is best used for high quality tasks
- Are we better off burning natural gas to heat our homes or burning it
  at a plant, converting to electricity, and then heating with
  electricity?

<!--

## World Electricity Prices
![](../figures/electricprices.png)

## World Oil Price
Oil prices have fluctuated by a factor of 4-5 over the last decade.
![](../figures/World_Oil_Prices_1970-2008.PNG)

## U.S Electricity Price
Electricity prices have only fluctuated by about 25% over the last
decade.
![](../figures/US_Electricity_Prices_1970-2008.PNG)

<!--
what are some plausible reasons for the difference in oil and
electricity volatility?
-->

## What do we use electricity for?
- In American homes:
- Air conditioning 22%
- Lighting 14%
- Water Heating 9%
- Refrigeration 9%
- Space heating 9%
- Electronics 7%
- Computers 4%
- Cooking 2%

## Global electricity
- Approximately 20% of population has no access to electricity

## African Proposed Grid
![](../figures/african-power-system.png)

## United States Grid
![](../figures/UnitedStatesPowerGrid.jpg)

## Demand
![](../figures/stacked_demand.pdf)

## Efficiency
- Do we build more plants to meet demand?
- Can we use efficiency to avoid demand?

## Distributed generation
- Can we create more generation without adding transmission?
- Can we make the electricity where we need it?

## Capacity Factor
- Related to the fraction of time that a plant produces electricity
- Coal and nuclear, about 80% or higher
- Renewables, about 20%


## What fraction of carbon emissions?
- Electricity is responsible for 33% of United States carbon dioxide
  emissions

## Quiz Review

## Learning Objectives
- Physics of heating and cooling
- Learn how we heat and cool our homes and buildings

## Heat transfer
- Conduction
- Convection
- Radiation

## Home Heat Transfer
- Like a cup of coffee, your warm house loses heat to the environment
- Our furnaces and bodies add heat

## Home cooling
- We cool our home but heat leaks in from outside

## Conduction
- Insulation

## Convection
- Weatherstripping
- Passive ventilation

## Radiation
- White roofs
- Advanced window coatings
- Passive solar heating


## Heating, Cooling, Ventilation
These devices consume energy to heat and cool our buildings

- Combustion
- Heat pumps
- Fans

## Different climates have different demands
- Cold winters
- Humid summers

## Heating energy
- energy used = leakiness of house * temperature difference / efficiency
  of heaters

## Sources of heat
- Combustion
- Sun
- Human metabolism
- Environment

## Heat capacity
$$ Q = m C \Delta T $$

Also called sensible heat

The energy to heat a material is the product of the mass, the heat
capacity, and the change in temperature

## Calorie and BTU
This is how we define the calorie and the BTU

A calorie (4.2 J) of energy raises one gram of water by one degree celsius

A BTU (1055 J) raises one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the potential for existing technologies to solve energy
  problems

<!-- we are laying the groundwork for you to have real influence -->
<!-- this means increasing your sophistication -->

## Pacala and Socolow
- Authors demonstrate solving climate problem with existing technologies
- Hoping to settle debate on whether current technologies are sufficient
- This is clearly stated in the introduction


## Pacala and Socolow
- What carbon level do the authors want us to stay under?
- Describe a wedge in your own words
- Which of the wedges suggested is most appealing to you and why?
- This paper is ten years old now, are there any new wedges we could
  add?

<!-- to understand this model, we look at stocks and flows -->

## Levels vs rates of emissions
- Bathtub model
- Stocks and flows
- Flow is the bathtub faucet (and drain)
- Stocks is the level of the bathtub water

## Bathtub model of carbon flows

## Carbon Emissions Trajectories
![Pacala and Socolow, Figure 1A](../figures/wedges1A.pdf)

## Simplified Trajectories
![Pacala and Socolow, Figure 1B](../figures/wedges1B.pdf)


## Carbon levels

| Time period   | Carbon concentration (ppm) |
|---------------|----------------------------|
| Preindustrial | 280                        |
| 2004          | 375                        |
| 2014          | 400                        |

We hope to remain under 500 ppm to avoid serious disruption.

## Carbon rates
- 7 billion tons of carbon per year
- (7 GtC/year)

## What is Business as Usual (BAU)?
- Prediction by using historical rates
- 1.5% annual emissions growth

## Wedges
A wedge is a technology that reduces emissions by 1 GtC/year within 50
years.

What are the units of area of a wedge?

## How do we calculate if a wedge is feasible?
- We can create a sample wedge from the conversion of all coal plants to
  natural gas
- How do we calculate the reduction in emissions from this change?

# Climate Change Consequences

## Climate change effects
- Mean temperature change of a few degrees
- Sea Level rise



## Climate Dice
- Small changes in mean temperature (1-2 C) don't describe increased
  extremes
- Distributions suggest much more warm weather

## Distributions
- When we shift the average temperature we also shift the extremes
- Cold extremes become less likely
- Hot extremes become more likely

## Climate dice
- James Hansen
- We can think of a weather pattern as a given die
- Climate change loads the die and changes the likelihood of
  different results for each roll of the die

## Warm anomalies
- A shift in the average temperature increases the likelihood of very
  hot weather

## Summer temperature anomalies

# How will we respond?

## Insurance
- Even though risk is uncertain, we protect ourselves.
- Auto insurance
- Fire insurance

## What will the future impacts be?
- Predictions based on computer climate models
- Confidence in models is increasing

## What can we do?
- Mitigation
- Adaptation
- (Geoengineering)

## Mitigation
- Actions that seek to reduce carbon emissions and avoid climate change

## Adaptation
- Actions that seek to minimize the affects of climate change


## Benefits and costs
- To pursue a plan, the benefits should outweigh the costs
