# Lecture 2 - History of energy


## What is energy?
- Energy is an accounting device
- Energy is never destroyed or lost, only converted

<!--
- word coined by aristotle
-->


## Basic Concepts
- Force
- Work
- Energy
- Power

<!--
- run through each concept
- apple weighs about 100g
- difference between work and energy is subtle
- can you come up with an example from each of these this morning?
-->

## Forms of Energy
- Gravitational
- Chemical
- Kinetic
- Radiation

## Energy conversion
- Conversion of energy is the key to making it useful
<!--
- example: chemical energy to mechanical energy
- write down an energy conversion from your life this morning
-->

# Energy in Antiquity

## Biological Energy Conversion
- Plants convert radiant energy into chemical energy
- Humans convert chemical energy into human activity
<!--
- We essentially burn food in our bodies
- since all fossil fuel comes from plants, it is essentially solar
-->

## Food Gathering Techniques
- Foraging
- Hunting
- Agriculture
- Livestock
<!--
- how can you see each of these in terms of energy?
- can we think of energy impacts of our modern food system?
-->


## Fire
- Stored chemical energy in wood to heat
- Allowed for tool making
- Allowed for cooking
<!--
- Richard Wrangham, primatologist argues that:
- cooking saves energy in digestion
-->

## Fire Sources
- Wood, biomass, dung
- Coal
- Coke
- Oil
- Gas
<!--
- what sources do humans burn for use
-->

## Amplifying human power and energy
- Ancient machines
    - Lever
    - Spring

<!--
- lever converts small force over large distance to large force over
  small distance
- springs store energy as mechanical potential energy
-->

## Hunting Machines
- Bow and arrow
    - energy is stored in bow and release quickly
- Spear and Lever
    - Lever allows hunter to impart more kinetic energy to the spear
      than with the arm alone
- Guns
    - Chemical energy converted to kinetic energy in bullet

<!--
- this advantage lead to higher energy input in human diets
-->

## Human Thermoregulation
- Our superior ability to remove heat energy from our bodies allows us
  to outrun prey animals


# Beyond Human Power

## Livestock
- Oxen
- Horses
- Allowed humans to cultivate more land, but required more land for food
<!--
- Horsepower
-->

## Water power
- Water wheels
    - converts kinetic and potential energy in water to rotational
      motion
    - estimated 500,000 waterwheels in Europe

## Water photos

## Wind power
- Windmills
    - converts kinetic energy in the wind to rotational motion
    - Dates to Ancient Greece
    - 12th century in Europe
    - estimated 200,000 windmills at peak in Europe
    - estimated 600,000 windmill waterpumps at peak in 1930 in United States
- Sailing
    - Allowed long distance travel

<!--
- transatlantic voyages made possible by windpower
- these first energy sources were renewable
- population in 1930 was about 122 million so about 200 persons per
  windmill

# Energy in the Fossil Fuel Era

## Steam Engine
- Invented by James Watt in approximately 1770
- Converts of chemical energy to heat to motion
- Created shift in manufacturing technology

## Internal Combustion Engine
- Inventions in the 1800s lead to first automobile patent by Karl Benz
  in 1886
<!--
- on paper write down positive and negative aspects of modern
  transportation
- then share with partner and then with class
- what are positive effects of transportation
    - goods, services
- what are negative effects?
    - pollution
    - deaths and injury
-->

## Electrification
- Coal is used as the fuel for electricity generation
<!--
- on paper, write down positive and negative aspects of electricity
- share with partner and then group
- positive effects of electricity?
- negative effects?
-->

# Consequences of Fossil Fuel Use

## Global Warming
- Widespread use of these fuels causes an increase in fossil carbon in
  the atmosphere
- Arhennius in 1896 calculated how changes in the levels of CO$_2$ could
  alter surface temperature

<!--
- what is beyond dispute
- what is still under debate
-->

## Nuclear Energy
- Mass converted to thermal energy
- 1950s see the first nuclear power plants
<!--
- still the same concept
- heat is used to boil water and power a turbine
-->

## Solar Energy
- Photoelectric effect discovered in 1916 by Millikan
- 1950s solar photovoltaic cells used on satellites
- Today, widespread use in private and commercial generation

## Solar Adoption
- 40 years to get to 50 GW of PV capacity
- 50 GW again in the last 2.5 years

## Future Energy Technologies?

<!--
- science-fiction time! name an invention, no matter how outlandish,
  that could impact or eliminate an energy use today.
    - efficient teleportation would eliminate car trips
    - hologram teleconferencing
    - 3D printing eliminates shipping
-->

<!--
- next time, energy physics, math, estimations
