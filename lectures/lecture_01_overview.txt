<!--
- take attendance
- introduce myself
- make myself approachable
-->


## Vision
- The combination of knowledge and skills you gain in this class will
  create a foundation for a lifetime of informed discussion and
  influence in the space of energy.

<!--
- this course is guided by what i want you to be able to do in your
  careers 5, 10, 20, and 50 years from now.
- we will do some things differently and you may find them strange, they
  are all designed to prepare you for what you will actually do in the
  future
-->

## Interview
- What do you want to get out of this class?
- How do you hope to use what you learn here in your career?
- What are you most curious about in the field of energy?
- What are you most concerned about in the field of energy?

<!--
- pick a partner and write down responses for the following questions
- this will be an ungraded assignment
- when finished, briefly introduce your partner to the class

## Syllabus Review
[My Website](http://danielrsoto.com/teaching/syllabus_330.html)

<!--
- course organization
- we begin with a discussion of energy and mathematical fundamentals
- we then cover different sources of energy
- how we use energy
- impacts of energy
- economics and policy
- discuss how tentative schedule is
- talk about selection of texts
-->

## Learning objectives
- You will gain knowledge of energy issues
- You will develop quantitative estimation skills and model thinking
- You will enhance your critical thinking skills
- You will apply research skills to energy issues

<!--
- some of these are related to the content
- some of these are not related to the content
-->

## Transfer of knowledge
- Certain energy facts will not change
    - Physics of energy, thermodynamics, economics
- Others will definitely change
    - Cheapest energy source, state of the art in technology, financing
      options

<!--
- can anyone name something in the world of energy that has changed
  significantly in the past several years?
-->

## Quantitative Estimation Skills
- You will leave this class with the ability to quantitatively evaluate
  new ideas for feasibility
- We will develop analytical tools and techniques for energy estimation

<!--
- show of hands, how comfortable are you with mathematics?
- how comfortable are you with physics?
- algebra?
- calculus?
-->

## Model thinking
- A model is an approximation that allows us to think about the world
- All models are wrong, some are useful
- How do we separate facts from opinions?

<!--
- who can name an example of a model?
- who can think of a place where models are useful?
- who knows who nate silver is?
-->

## Critical thinking skills
- How do you gain information about a topic?
- How do evaluate the quality of that information?
- How do you assess the quality of an argument?

<!--
- show of hands, how many are comfortable with this topic?
- i don't feel like i developed this until midway through graduate
  school
-->

## Research skills
- How do you discover more about a topic?
- How do you synthesize this information to answer a question?
- How do you find the right question to ask?
