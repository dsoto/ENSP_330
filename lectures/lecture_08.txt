<!--
## Benefits of fossil fuels

## Drawbacks to fossil fuel use

## Energy return on investment

## Fossil fuel prices in real dollars

## Increased cost with unconventional sources


-->

## Energy independence

## Carbon intensity

## Fossil Fuel Subsidies
- exploration expensing
- unpriced externalities

## Politics
- 2006 House passed bill to allow immediate offshore drilling
- Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR)
- Drilling on federal lands

## Supply and demand
- Does increased domestic drilling lower domestic prices?
<!--
- does increased energy supply decrease prices?

## Efficiency of conversion

## Efficiency calculation example
- Coal plant

## Numerical Examples

## Heat Rate in Power Plant

## Limit of refrigerator efficiency

## Segue into laws of thermodynamics
