## Thermal energy
- Thermal energy proportional to
    - mass of the object
    - difference in temperature
    - heat capacity of material
$$Q = E_{thermal} = m c \Delta T$$


## Temperature
- Measure of the internal energy in a system or material
- This energy is the motion, vibration, or rotation of atoms and
  molecules

## Heat
- Heat is the flow of this energy from one area to another

<!--
draw temperature
draw heat flow
-->

## Methods of heat transfer
- Conduction
- Convection
- Radiation

## Chemical energy
- Heat of combustion
- Higher heating value
- Lower heating value

## Fuels
- Gasoline 44--45 MJ/kg
- Crude oil 42--44
- Natural gas 33--37
- Anthracite coal 29--31
- Bituminous coal 22--26
- Lignite coal 12--20
- Wood 14--16
- Straw 12--15

## Exercise
- Using one kg of coal
    - How much energy (in J) is the coal?
    - How much electricity in kWh can we generate assuming 35% efficiency?
    - How much water can we raise in temperature from 15C to 50C
      assuming 100% efficiency?

<!--
make a list of assumptions and units
draw on board to support exercise
anthracite coal 30 MJ/kg
3.6 MJ/kWh
how much electricity if 100% efficient?
how much if 30% efficient?
-->

## Exercise
- How much energy did it take to heat your shower water this morning?
- Calculate in joules and kWh

<!--
make a list of assumptions and units
this is part back of the envelope and part calculation
how long is your shower?
how much water per minute? 2 gallons per minute
how much volume per mass? 3.79 liters per gallon
we can derive heat capacity from calorie
4.186 J per g of water
how hot is shower water?
how hot did it start?

# Thermodynamics and heat engines

## Heat Engines
- Stored chemical energy is burned to create thermal energy
- Thermal energy is converted into mechanical work

## Heat Engine

## Carnot Heat Engine
![](./figures/carnot_cycle.png)
- Heat is used to expand a gas and do work and heat is removed during
  the compression of the gas.

## Heat Engines
- Heat engines have limits to efficiency dictated by the laws of
  thermodynamics
- Maximum possible efficiency is related to the temperature of the hot
  reservoir and of the cold reservoir

## Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics
- If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system,
  they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other.

## First Law of Thermodynamics
- Energy is conserved
- Energy cannot be created or destroyed
- "You can't get something for nothing"

## First Law Efficiency
- Most commonly used measure of efficiency
- Useful energy out divided by total energy in

## Second Law of Thermodynamics
- The amount of entropy (disorder) in a closed system always increases
- Heat flows spontaneously from hot to cold
- "You can't break even"

## Second Law Efficiency
- First law efficiency divided by best possible efficiency dictated by
  the second law
- It isn't always obvious what the best possible second law efficiency is

## Third law of Thermodynamics
- The entropy of a perfect crystal at absolute zero is exactly equal to
  zero.
- When we make calculations using the second law, we use the kelvin
  temperature scale which starts at absolute zero.

## Temperature Scales
![](./figures/temperature_scales.jpg)

## Entropy
- Measures the disorder in a system
- Is related to the number of microstates

## Quality

## Thermodynamic limit to heat engine
- Carnot derived the upper limit of efficiency for a heat engine
$$\eta = 1 - \frac{T_C}{T_H}$$

<!--
what happens when T_C goes to zero?
what happens when T_C and T_H are close to each other?
